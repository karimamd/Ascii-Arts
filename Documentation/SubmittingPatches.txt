If you do not have a repository with the current source handy: use git to obtain one.

You'll want to start with the mainline repository which can be grabbed with git clone:

https://github.com/oddcoder/Ascii-Arts.git 

It is always recommended to create your changes a branch other than main branch.

You can create new branch using the git command: git branch branch_name

Once you have created your branch you can switch to it with git command: git checkout branch_name

Now you can create your changes to your branch

Once you finish you can get a patch file with this command: git format-patch master..branch_name
and you got your patch!

Now you can send it in email to (ahmedsoliman0x666@gmail.com)
It will take up to 15 days to get your patch applied 
In case you got no response : please send the patch again.
